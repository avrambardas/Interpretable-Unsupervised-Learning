LXDR: Local Explanation of Dimensionality Reduction

In this repo, you can find the code of LXDR and its experiments for our preliminary work as presented in SETN2020, with title Local Explanation of Dimensionality Reduction, in the folder "[Preliminary (SETN 2022)](https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Interpretable-Unsupervised-Learning/tree/main/Preliminary%20(SETN%202022))", and the newer, more complete version of LXDR, as submitted in IEEE Access, with title Exploring Local Interpretability in Dimensionality Reduction: Analysis and Use Cases, in the folder "[LXDR](https://github.com/intelligence-csd-auth-gr/Interpretable-Unsupervised-Learning/tree/main/LXDR)".
